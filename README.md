# Sslac is now retired!
## But we have options for you :)

Looking for an awesome class based library? Here's some options...

* Fiber.js - https://github.com/linkedin/Fiber - the Fiber library is a great option when you're looking for performance. It's faster than Sslac, and smaller in file size.
* JSFace - https://github.com/tnhu/jsface - the JSFace library is similar to Sslac in spirit, but works beyond just in browsers (also node.js friendly) and has support for polymorphic functions. If you're looking for classical OOP in JS, it's pretty hard to beat.

Thanks to everyone who's been so supportive of the library. This will remain as a reference implementation.
